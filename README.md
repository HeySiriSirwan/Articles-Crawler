# Articles-Crawler

**Articles-Crawler** is a Python tool designed to crawl and extract articles from journal websites. Users can analyze word trends (annual and monthly) and generate word clouds to visualize word frequency.

âš  **Note:** This project requires user customization. You need to configure the target journal website and provide the path to your Chrome WebDriver.

## Configuration

### 1. Set Your Journal Website
Edit the `crawler.py` file to include the URL(s) of the journal website(s) you want to crawl.

   ```python
   target_url = "https://example-journal.com"  # Replace with your journal website
  ```

### 2. Provide Chrome WebDriver Path

   ```python
   chromedriver_path = "/path/to/your/chromedriver"  # Replace with your WebDriver path
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main crawler script to collect articles:

   ```bash
   python crawler.py
   ```

   This will extract articles from the configured journal website.

2. Analyze annual word trends:

   ```bash
   python annual_word_trends.py
   ```

3. Analyze monthly word trends:

   ```bash
   python monthly_word_trends.py
   ```

4. Analyze monthly trends for a specific word:

  ```bash
   python monthly_word_trends_per_word.py
   ```

5. Generate a word cloud:

   ```bash
   python word_cloud.py
   ```
